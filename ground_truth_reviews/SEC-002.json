      "comment": "The `delete_post` endpoint is missing an authentication check. This makes it possible for any unauthenticated user to delete arbitrary posts from the database simply by knowing their ID. This is a critical security vulnerability as it allows for unauthorized data modification and destruction. To fix this, you must enforce authentication on this endpoint by adding a dependency that verifies the user's identity, ensuring only authorized users can perform this action."
