      "comment": "The current implementation uses an explicit for-loop to build a list of titles. This can be made more concise and idiomatic by using a list comprehension, which is generally preferred in Python for this type of transformation and filtering. A list comprehension is often more readable and can be more performant.\n\nThe body of this function can be simplified to a single line:\n```python\nreturn [post.title for post in posts if post.is_published]\n```"
