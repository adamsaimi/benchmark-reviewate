      "comment": "This `create_post` method violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). It currently handles three distinct responsibilities: validating the author's email, creating the post entity, and sending a notification. This tight coupling makes the method difficult to test, maintain, and reason about. For instance, testing the post creation logic now also requires dealing with the notification side-effect, and changes to validation rules will require modifying this core business logic. These responsibilities should be separated into dedicated components (e.g., a validator, a repository, and a notification service), which the `PostService` would then orchestrate."
