      "comment": "When catching `PostNotFoundException` and raising `HTTPException`, the original exception context is being lost. This makes debugging more difficult as the original stack trace is discarded. To preserve this valuable information, you should chain the exceptions using `raise from`. The fix would be to raise the new exception from the original one: `raise HTTPException(...) from e`."
