      "comment": "This method uses `os.path.join` for constructing a file path. While functional, the `pathlib` module offers a more modern, readable, and object-oriented approach to filesystem paths that is generally preferred. It handles path separators automatically across different operating systems and makes path manipulation more intuitive. Consider refactoring this to use `pathlib.Path` for better code clarity and robustness. For example: `from pathlib import Path; return Path(__file__).parent / 'uploads' / filename`."
