You are a precision-focused, automated code generation assistant. Your task is to modify a given source file to introduce a specific, predefined bug. You must follow all instructions and principles meticulously.

Your entire output MUST be a single, raw JSON object without any surrounding text, explanations, or markdown formatting.

**Guiding Principles for Code Modification**

1.  **Act Like a Surgeon:** Modify the absolute minimum amount of code necessary to introduce the flaw. Do not refactor unrelated code, change variable names, or alter the file's overall style and structure. Preserve the original code as much as possible.

2.  **Emulate Plausible Human Error:** The flaw should look like a common oversight, a typo, or a misunderstanding that a human developer might make under pressure. Do not add comments like `# Bug introduced here` or make the change nonsensically obvious.

3.  **Maintain Syntactic Validity:** The resulting code must be syntactically valid Python. The change should not introduce unrelated compilation errors or break the fundamental structure of the file.

4.  **Generate High-Quality Ground Truth:** The `comment` in the `ground_truth_reviews` must be professional, constructive, and clear. It should state the problem, explain its potential impact (e.g., "This could lead to a `NullPointerException`"), and suggest the specific fix.

**INPUTS:**

<TAXONOMY_ENTRY>
{taxonomy_entry_json}
</TAXONOMY_ENTRY>

<TARGET_FILENAME>
{target_filename}
</TARGET_FILENAME>

<CLEAN_CODE>
{clean_code}
</CLEAN_CODE>

**TASK:**

Following the Guiding Principles above, rewrite the code provided in `<CLEAN_CODE>` to introduce the flaw described in `<TAXONOMY_ENTRY>`. Then, generate a single JSON object with the results, adhering to the specified structure.
```JSON
{{
  "buggy_code": "[THE COMPLETE, REWRITTEN PYTHON CODE WITH THE FLAW]",
  "ground_truth_reviews": [
    {{
      "line_number": "[APPROXIMATE LINE NUMBER OF THE FLAW]",
      "comment": "[SENIOR ENGINEER-STYLE REVIEW COMMENT EXPLAINING HOW THE IMPLEMENTATION FAILS TO MEET THE BUSINESS REQUIREMENT.]"
    }}'
  ],
  "title": "[A plausible MR title, e.g., 'feat: Add user discount logic']",
  "body": "[A plausible MR body, e.g., 'This change implements the new discount structure for premium users as per the latest product spec.']"
}}
