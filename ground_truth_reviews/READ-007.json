      "comment": "This conditional expression is very complex and difficult to parse at a glance. Long, nested boolean logic like this increases cognitive load and makes the code harder to debug and maintain. To improve readability, please refactor this by extracting the sub-conditions into well-named boolean variables. For example, you could create variables like `is_privileged_subscriber` and `is_long_term_user` to make the final `if` statement read more like natural language."
