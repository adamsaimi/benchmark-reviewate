      "comment": "The variable names `p` and `d` are too generic and don't convey their purpose. `p` should be renamed to something more descriptive like `post_create`, and `d` should be renamed to `post_dict` to clarify that it's a dictionary representation of a post. Using clear variable names is crucial for code readability and maintainability."
