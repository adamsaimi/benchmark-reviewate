      "comment": "The method creates a generator expression but immediately converts it to a list. This negates the memory-saving benefits of using a generator, as it loads the entire collection of posts into memory at once. If the number of posts is large, this will cause significant memory pressure and potential performance issues. To fix this, the method should return the generator directly and the return type hint should be updated to `Iterator[Post]` to allow consumers to process the data as a stream."
