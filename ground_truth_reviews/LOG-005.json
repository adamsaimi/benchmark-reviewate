      "comment": "The default argument for `filters` is a mutable dictionary (`{}`). This object is created only once when the function is defined. When the function is called without a `filters` argument, it modifies this default dictionary in place. Subsequent calls without arguments will reuse the same modified dictionary, leading to unexpected filtering behavior that persists across calls. To fix this, change the default argument to `None` and initialize a new dictionary inside the function: `if filters is None: filters = {}`."
