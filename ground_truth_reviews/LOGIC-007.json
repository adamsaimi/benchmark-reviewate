      "comment": "The exception handling order is incorrect. Catching the general `Exception` class before more specific exceptions like `ValueError` means the specific handlers will never be reached. Because `ValueError` is a subclass of `Exception`, it will always be caught by the first `except Exception` block, making the `except ValueError` block unreachable. To ensure correct error handling, exception handlers must be ordered from most specific to most general."
