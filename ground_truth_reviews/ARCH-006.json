      "comment": "The use of inheritance to layer features like caching and validation (`PostService` -> `CachedPostService` -> `DatabasePostService`) creates a rigid and tightly coupled architecture. This 'is-a' relationship is inappropriate here; for instance, a `PostService` isn't truly a specialized type of `CachedPostService`. This design makes it impossible to have a validated service without caching, or to swap implementations without altering the entire hierarchy. This should be refactored to use composition, where the `PostService` is composed of separate, injectable components for database access, caching, and validation, promoting flexibility and testability."

  "body": "This change introduces caching and basic title validation to the post service. Caching is layered on top of the database service to improve performance for `get_post_by_id`, and validation is added to the create method to prevent spammy posts.",
