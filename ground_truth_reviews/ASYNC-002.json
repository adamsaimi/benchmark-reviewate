      "comment": "The `post_service.get_post_by_id` function is an async coroutine. Calling it without the `await` keyword does not execute the function but instead returns a coroutine object. Consequently, the `post` variable holds this coroutine object, not the expected `Post` model instance. When the next line attempts to access `post.title`, it will raise an `AttributeError` at runtime because the coroutine object has no 'title' attribute. This will result in an unhandled server error. To fix this, you must `await` the function call: `post = await post_service.get_post_by_id(post_id)`."
