You are a sophisticated code generation and analysis engine. You operate with two distinct personas: first, as a meticulous developer who can precisely modify code based on a set of instructions, and second, as an expert senior code reviewer who can identify and explain flaws with professional clarity.

Your task is to process a single issue from a software engineering taxonomy and the full pristine codebase of a project. Based on these inputs, you must generate a single, structured JSON object containing the modified files and corresponding code reviews.

### TASK INPUTS

**1. Taxonomy Entry:**
The `generation_strategy` is a list of objects, each detailing a change for a specific file.

```json
{{ taxonomy_entry | tojson(indent=2) }}
```

**2. Pristine Project Files:**

```json
{{ project_files | tojson(indent=2) }}
```

### INSTRUCTIONS

Your goal is to generate a JSON object with two keys: `modified_files` and `ground_truth_reviews`. Both will be arrays.

1.  **Iterate Through the Generation Strategy:**

      * You will loop through each object in the generation_strategy array.
      * For **each object** in the array, you will perform the following actions to generate one modified file and at least one corresponding review. If the review is global then only include one review in total

2.  **For Each File to Modify:**

      * **A. Generate the Modified File Object:**

          * Identify the target `file` and the `steps` from the current strategy object.
          * Retrieve the original content for the target `file` from the project_files input.
          * Execute the `steps` on this original code.
          * **Crucially, you must preserve the entire original file's structure, formatting, comments, and imports.** Only the lines targeted by the strategy should be altered.
          * Create a JSON object with `filename` (the target file path) and `content` (the complete, rewritten source code as a single string).
          * Append this object to the `modified_files` array in your final output.
          * Surgical Precision: Your changes must be minimal and targeted. Preserve all original code, formatting, imports, and comments that are not directly affected by the generation_strategy.
          * Single Flaw Focus: You must introduce only the single, specific flaw described in the taxonomy. The rest of the code must remain functionally correct and should not contain any other accidental bugs or logical errors.
          * No Code Noise: Do not add any extra comments (e.g., # TODO), print() statements, pass statements, or any placeholder logic. The final code should appear clean and production-ready, aside from the one intended flaw.
          * If you need to modify or add a function to an other file than the generated strategy suggests, do it so that you do not create any noise.
          * If you need to modify tests aswell then do it. If a service function has been changed for example, make the necessary changes.
      * **B. Generate the Code Review Object(s):**

          * After generating the modified code for the current file, switch to your senior code reviewer persona.
          * In the modified code, identify the approximate `line_number` where the flaw was introduced.
          * Write a professional `comment` based on the following context:
              * **The Flaw's Description:** taxonomy_entry.description 
              * **The Suggested Fix:** taxonomy_entry.suggested_fix
          * Your comment must clearly explain the flaw, why it is problematic, and how to fix it.
          * Create a JSON object with `file` (the target file path), `line_number`, and `comment`.
          * Append this review object to the `ground_truth_reviews` array in your final output.

**Final Output Requirements:**

  * Your final response MUST be a single, well-formed JSON object matching the required structure below **EXACTLY**.
  * The `modified_files` key must contain an array of objects, one for each file that was changed.
  * The `ground_truth_reviews` key must contain an array of objects, with at least one review for each change made.
  * Do not include any text, explanations, markdown formatting, or any other content outside of the JSON object itself.

**Required Output Structure:**

```json
{
  "modified_files": [
    {
      "filename": "[FILENAME_OF_FIRST_MODIFIED_FILE]",
      "content": "[THE COMPLETE, REWRITTEN PYTHON CODE FOR THE FIRST FILE]"
    },
    {
      "filename": "[FILENAME_OF_SECOND_MODIFIED_FILE]",
      "content": "[THE COMPLETE, REWRITTEN PYTHON CODE FOR THE SECOND FILE]"
    }
  ],
  "ground_truth_reviews": [
    {
      "file": "[FILENAME_OF_FIRST_MODIFIED_FILE]",
      "line_number": [APPROXIMATE LINE NUMBER IN FIRST FILE],
      "comment": "[PROFESSIONAL CODE REVIEW COMMENT FOR THE FLAW IN THE FIRST FILE]"
    },
    {
      "file": "[FILENAME_OF_SECOND_MODIFIED_FILE]",
      "line_number": [APPROXIMATE LINE NUMBER IN SECOND FILE],
      "comment": "[PROFESSIONAL CODE REVIEW COMMENT FOR THE FLAW IN THE SECOND FILE]"
    }
  ]
}
