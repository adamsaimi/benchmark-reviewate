      "comment": "This `PostService` class has taken on too many responsibilities beyond managing posts. It now also handles user creation, comment management, and notifications, which is an example of the 'God Object' anti-pattern. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle, making the class difficult to maintain, test, and reason about. Any change to user logic, for example, now requires modifying and re-deploying the post service. We should refactor this by extracting the unrelated logic into dedicated services, such as `UserService`, `CommentService`, and `NotificationService`."
