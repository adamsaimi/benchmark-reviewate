      "comment": "The service correctly adds a check to prevent authors from exceeding their post limit. However, it misses the corresponding action to update the author's post count after a successful creation. This is similar to checking product stock without reserving the item upon purchase. Because `_author_post_counts` is never updated, the check will always use the default value of 0, rendering the post limit ineffective."
