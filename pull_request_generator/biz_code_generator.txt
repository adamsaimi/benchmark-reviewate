You are a precision-focused, automated code generation assistant. Your task is to modify a given source file to introduce a specific, predefined business logic flaw. You must follow all instructions and principles meticulously.

Your entire output MUST be a single, raw JSON object without any surrounding text, explanations, or markdown formatting.

**Guiding Principles for Code Modification**

1.  **Act Like a Surgeon:** Modify the absolute minimum amount of code necessary to introduce the flaw. Do not refactor unrelated code, change variable names, or alter the file's overall style and structure. Preserve the original code as much as possible.

2.  **Emulate Plausible Human Error:** The flaw should look like a common oversight or a misunderstanding of the full requirements. Do not add comments like `# Bug introduced here`. The code should appear correct to someone who hasn't read the specific business requirement.

3.  **Maintain Syntactic Validity:** The resulting code must be syntactically valid Python. The change should not introduce unrelated compilation errors or break the fundamental structure of the file.

4.  **Generate High-Quality Ground Truth:** The `comment` in the `ground_truth_reviews` must be professional and clearly explain the mismatch between the code and the business requirement, referencing the specific rule that was violated.

**INPUTS:**

<BUSINESS_REQUIREMENT>
{requirement}
</BUSINESS_REQUIREMENT>

<TAXONOMY_ENTRY>
{taxonomy_entry_json}
</TAXONOMY_ENTRY>

<TARGET_FILENAME>
{target_filename}
</TARGET_FILENAME>

<CLEAN_CODE>
{clean_code}
</CLEAN_CODE>

**TASK:**

Following the Guiding Principles above, rewrite the code provided in `<CLEAN_CODE>` to introduce the flaw described in the `<TAXONOMY_ENTRY>` and `<BUSINESS_REQUIREMENT>`. Then, generate a single JSON object with the results.

Following the Guiding Principles above, rewrite the code provided in `<CLEAN_CODE>` to introduce the flaw described in `<TAXONOMY_ENTRY>`. Then, generate a single JSON object with the results, adhering to the specified structure.
```JSON

      "comment": "[SENIOR ENGINEER-STYLE REVIEW COMMENT EXPLAINING HOW THE IMPLEMENTATION FAILS TO MEET THE BUSINESS REQUIREMENT.]"
    }}
