It fetches all posts in one query (`get_all_posts`) and then executes a separate query (`_get_user_by_email`) inside the loop for each post to get author details. As the number of posts grows, this will lead to a large number of database calls, severely impacting performance. To fix this, you should fetch all posts and their related authors in a single, more efficient operation, for example by joining the posts and users tables in the initial query or by fetching all required authors in a second, batched query after the initial post fetch."
