      "comment": "Manually opening and closing file resources is discouraged because it can lead to resource leaks. If an exception occurs during `json.load(f)` (e.g., due to invalid JSON), the `f.close()` line will never be reached, and the file handle will remain open. To prevent this, you should use a context manager (`with` statement), which guarantees that the file will be closed automatically, even if errors occur. The correct implementation would be: `with open(filename, \"r\") as f: return json.load(f)`."
