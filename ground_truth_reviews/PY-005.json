This practice is error-prone, as typos can introduce subtle bugs that are hard to track down, and it makes it difficult to discover all possible valid statuses. Please define an `Enum` for post statuses (e.g., `PostStatus`) and use its members here (e.g., `PostStatus.DRAFT.value`) to improve code clarity, maintainability, and type safety."
