      "comment": "The 'author_email' column is being added without a database index. The new '/posts/by-author' endpoint filters directly on this column, which will force the database to perform a full table scan for every request. As the 'posts' table grows, this query will become a significant performance bottleneck. To ensure efficient lookups, an index should be added to this column. The fix is to add `index=True` to the column definition: `author_email = Column(String, index=True)`."
