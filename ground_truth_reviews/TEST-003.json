      "comment": "This test is dependent on `test_create_post` running successfully before it, as it relies on the `created_post_details` global variable. This breaks test isolation, making the test suite fragile. If this test is run in isolation or if the test order changes, it will fail with a `KeyError`. Tests should be self-contained; please refactor this to create its own required data, for example by moving the post creation logic back into this test or by using a pytest fixture."
