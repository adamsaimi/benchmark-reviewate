      "comment": "This method constructs a raw SQL query using an f-string, which directly embeds the `author_email` parameter into the query string. This creates a severe SQL injection vulnerability. A malicious user could provide a crafted email string (e.g., `' OR 1=1 --`) to manipulate the query, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. To fix this, you must use parameterized queries where the query string uses placeholders (like `%s` or `?`) and the actual values are passed as a separate argument to the database execution method."
