This is a critical security vulnerability as it allows any unauthenticated user to delete arbitrary posts from the system by simply knowing their ID. Please add an authentication dependency (e.g., `current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)`) to the function signature to ensure only authorized users can perform this destructive action."
