      "comment": "The current implementation iterates through all provided promotional codes and applies them sequentially without any validation. This creates a business logic vulnerability where a user can stack multiple discounts on a single order, leading to unintended price reductions and potential revenue loss. Business rules require that only one promotional code can be applied per order. To fix this, we must add a validation check at the beginning of the method to ensure the `promo_codes` list contains no more than one code. If it does, a `ValidationError` or a similar exception should be raised."
