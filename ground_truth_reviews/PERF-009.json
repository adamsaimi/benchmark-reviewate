      "comment": "This endpoint performs two aggregate database queries (`COUNT` and `AVG`) on every single request. These operations can be resource-intensive, especially as the 'posts' table grows. Since this statistical data is unlikely to change frequently, re-calculating it on every call is inefficient and can lead to performance bottlenecks under load. To mitigate this, consider implementing a caching mechanism. A time-based cache (e.g., using `fastapi-cache` with an expiration of a few minutes) would prevent redundant database queries by serving a stored result for subsequent requests, significantly improving response time and reducing database load."
