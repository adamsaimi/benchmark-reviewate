      "comment": "The `PostCache` class is designed as a lightweight object that may be instantiated many times. By default, Python classes use a `__dict__` to store instance attributes, which is memory-intensive when creating a large number of objects. To optimize memory usage for this class, you should define `__slots__` to pre-declare the instance attributes. This prevents the creation of `__dict__` for each instance, significantly reducing its memory footprint.\n\nSuggested fix:\n```python\nclass PostCache:\n    __slots__ = ['id', 'title', 'timestamp']\n\n    def __init__(self, id: int, title: str, timestamp: datetime):\n        self.id = id\n        self.title = title\n        self.timestamp = timestamp\n```"
