      "comment": "The background task created with `asyncio.create_task` is unreferenced, making it a \"fire-and-forget\" task. This can lead to silent failures if the task raises an exception, and complicates graceful application shutdown as there is no way to track or await its completion. For a more robust implementation, consider using FastAPI's built-in `BackgroundTasks` feature, which is designed for this purpose, or explicitly manage the task's lifecycle by storing a reference and handling its result or exceptions."
