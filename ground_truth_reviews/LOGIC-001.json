      "comment": "The pagination offset calculation is incorrect, leading to an off-by-one error. The formula `page * per_page` causes page 1 to skip the first set of results. For instance, if `per_page` is 10, a request for page 1 will incorrectly start from the 11th item. The standard and correct approach is to calculate the offset as `(page - 1) * per_page` to ensure that page 1 starts with an offset of 0."
