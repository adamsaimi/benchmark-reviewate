      "comment": "The loop condition `range(len(_posts_db) - 1)` introduces an off-by-one error. It causes the loop to terminate before checking the last element in the `_posts_db` list. As a result, the last post added to the database will never be found. To fix this, the range should be `range(len(_posts_db))` to ensure all elements are checked."
