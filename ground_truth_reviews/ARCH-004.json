      "comment": "The router endpoint is directly coupled to the in-memory database (`posts_db`). This violates the separation of concerns between the API layer and the data access layer. It makes the application harder to test and maintain, as any change to the data storage mechanism (e.g., switching to a real database) would require modifying the HTTP routing logic. Please delegate data access to the `PostService` by calling `post_service.get_post_by_id(post_id)` and handling the `PostNotFoundException` as it was previously."
