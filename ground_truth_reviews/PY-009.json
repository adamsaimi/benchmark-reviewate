      "comment": "The type check is implemented using multiple `isinstance` calls chained with `or`. This pattern is less efficient and less idiomatic than passing a tuple of types to a single `isinstance` call. The function can check against multiple types more cleanly and performantly with a single call.\n\nTo improve this, you should combine the type checks into one:\n\n```python\nif isinstance(value, (int, str, float)):\n    return True\n```"
