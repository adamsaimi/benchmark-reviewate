      "comment": "The `get_post` function is declared as `async`, but the call to `post_service.get_post_by_id(post_id)` is not being awaited. This will cause the endpoint to return a coroutine object instead of the actual `Post` data. When FastAPI attempts to serialize the response, it will fail because the coroutine object does not match the `Post` response model, leading to a server-side error. The call should be awaited to ensure the asynchronous operation completes and returns the expected data: `return await post_service.get_post_by_id(post_id)`."
