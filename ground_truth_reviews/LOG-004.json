      "comment": "Catching the generic `Exception` here is too broad. It will swallow any and all errors that occur within the `try` block, including potential database connection issues or serialization errors, and incorrectly report them all as a 'Not Found' (404) error. This makes debugging incredibly difficult as the true root cause is hidden. We should only catch the specific `PostNotFoundException` that we expect to be raised when a post isn't found."
