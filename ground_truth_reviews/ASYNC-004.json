      "comment": "The current implementation of `asyncio.gather` does not handle exceptions from individual tasks. If any call to `_verify_post_exists` fails (e.g., if a post is not found), the exception will propagate immediately, causing the entire batch operation to fail and return a 500 error. This prevents the successful verification of other posts in the batch. To make this endpoint more resilient, you should use `await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)` and then process the results list, which will contain either the successful results or the exception objects for failed tasks."
