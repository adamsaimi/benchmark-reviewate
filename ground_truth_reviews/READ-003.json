      "comment": "This function has become overly long and is handling multiple responsibilities, including input validation, content sanitization, business rule checks, data persistence, and side effects like logging and notifications. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and makes the code difficult to test and maintain. I recommend refactoring this by introducing a service layer to encapsulate the business logic (validation, sanitization, creation) and a data access layer (or repository) for persistence. The controller's role should be limited to parsing the request, calling the service, and formatting the response."
