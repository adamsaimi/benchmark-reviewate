      "comment": "The comparison `datetime.now() > db_post.created_at` is unsafe because it compares a naive datetime object with a timezone-aware one. The `created_at` field is stored with timezone information (UTC), while `datetime.now()` produces a naive datetime based on the system's local time. This will raise a `TypeError` at runtime, preventing the code from executing correctly. To fix this, you must use a timezone-aware datetime for the current time. The recommended approach is to import `timezone` from the `datetime` module and use `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` for the comparison."
