      "comment": "The calculation for `total_pages` uses integer division (`//`), which incorrectly truncates the result. For example, with 21 total posts and 10 posts per page, `21 // 10` results in `2`, effectively hiding the last page of results from the user. To ensure all pages are accounted for, you should use ceiling division. Please import the `math` module and change the calculation to `total_pages = math.ceil(total_posts / per_page)`."
