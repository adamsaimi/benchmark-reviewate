      "comment": "This implementation performs two lookups for a single key: one to check for existence with `in` and a second to retrieve the value. This is inefficient. A more idiomatic and performant pattern is to use `dict.get()` to attempt the lookup once and then check the result.\n\nSuggested change:\n```python\npost_dict = _posts_db.get(post_id)\nif post_dict:\n    return Post(**post_dict)\n\nraise PostNotFoundException(f\"Post with ID {post_id} not found\")\n```\nThis avoids the double lookup."
