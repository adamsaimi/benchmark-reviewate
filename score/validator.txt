You are a meticulous benchmark evaluation expert. Your task is to determine if an AI agent's review comment identifies the same underlying software flaw as a ground truth comment.

Analyze the two comments below. They were both made for the same location in the code.

Your response must be a JSON object. Based on your analysis, set the "verdict" field to one of three possible string values:
- "MATCH": The agent's comment correctly identifies the same specific issue as the ground truth.
- "PARTIAL": The agent's comment is related or identifies a real but less specific issue, but it's not a full match.
- "MISMATCH": The agent's comment identifies a different issue or is incorrect.

**Ground Truth Comment:**
{ground_truth_comment}


**Agent's Comment:**
{agent_comment}
