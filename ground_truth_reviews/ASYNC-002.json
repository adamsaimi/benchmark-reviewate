      "comment": "This `increment_likes` endpoint contains a race condition. Since it's an `async` function, multiple requests can interleave their execution. Specifically, two concurrent requests could both read the value of `like_counter`, then both yield control during `await asyncio.sleep()`. When they resume, they will both write back the same incremented value, causing one of the 'like' operations to be lost. To ensure atomicity for this read-modify-write operation, you should protect the critical section with an `asyncio.Lock`."
