      "comment": "When a user selects a date and time, `date.toISOString()` is called to format it. This method always returns a timestamp in UTC (Z) timezone. If a user in a different timezone (e.g., UTC+2) selects '10:00', this will be converted to '08:00Z'. When this UTC time is displayed back to the user in their local timezone, they will see '08:00', which is not what they originally selected. To fix this, we should format the date in a way that preserves the local timezone information or avoids timezone conversion altogether if not required."
