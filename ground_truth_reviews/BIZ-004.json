      "comment": "The access control logic correctly validates that users can only edit their own posts and that administrators can edit any post. However, it's missing the critical business requirement that all edits must be within 24 hours of the post's creation. Without this time-based validation, users and admins can edit posts indefinitely, which violates the business rule. We need to add a check: `if datetime.now(timezone.utc) - post_dict['created_at'] > timedelta(hours=24): raise UnauthorizedAccessException('Post can only be edited within 24 hours of creation')` before allowing the update."
