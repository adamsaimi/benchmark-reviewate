      "comment": "This endpoint is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. The `content` query parameter is directly embedded into the HTML response using an f-string without any sanitization or escaping. An attacker could provide a malicious script as input (e.g., `<script>alert(1)</script>`), which would then be executed in the browser of any user viewing the preview. To fix this, you should always escape user-provided data before rendering it in an HTML context. You can use `html.escape(content)` or, for more complex HTML, a templating engine like Jinja2 which handles auto-escaping by default."
