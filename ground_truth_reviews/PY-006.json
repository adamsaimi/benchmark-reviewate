      "comment": "This class is a simple data container. Instead of manually implementing `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__`, it's better to use the `@dataclass` decorator from Python's standard library. This will make the code more concise, less error-prone, and easier to maintain by automatically generating these common methods. You can refactor this by adding `from dataclasses import dataclass`, decorating the class with `@dataclass`, and then defining only the fields with type hints."
