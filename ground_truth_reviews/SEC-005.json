      "comment": "This endpoint is vulnerable to mass assignment. By accepting a raw dictionary and using `setattr` to update the model, an attacker can modify any attribute of the `Post` object, including protected fields like `id`, `author_id`, or `created_at`. This could allow an unauthorized user to change a post's author, for example. To fix this, replace the `data: dict` parameter with a dedicated Pydantic model for updates that explicitly lists only the fields that should be user-modifiable (e.g., `title`, `content`)."
