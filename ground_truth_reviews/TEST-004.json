      "comment": "This test makes a direct network call to an external API (`jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`) to fetch test data. This is an anti-pattern for unit tests as it introduces external dependencies, making the test suite slow, unreliable, and non-deterministic. If the external API is unavailable or changes, this test will fail, even if the application code is correct. Please mock the HTTP request using a library like `unittest.mock.patch` or `requests-mock` to ensure the test is isolated and runs predictably."
