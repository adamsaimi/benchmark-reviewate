      "comment": "The call to `get_max_length(config)` is inside the `for` loop. Since the `config` dictionary doesn't change during the loop's execution, the function's return value will be the same for every iteration. This leads to unnecessary and potentially expensive repeated computations, especially if `get_max_length` were to perform a database query or a complex calculation. To optimize this, the value should be fetched once before the loop and stored in a local variable."
