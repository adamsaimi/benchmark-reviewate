      "comment": "The manual management of the `index` variable is unnecessary and not idiomatic Python. Initializing a counter to zero before a loop and incrementing it inside the loop is a pattern inherited from other languages. Python provides a more elegant and robust solution with the built-in `enumerate()` function. Using `enumerate()` simplifies the code, reduces the chance of errors (like forgetting to increment the counter), and makes the code's intent clearer. The loop can be refactored to `for index, post in enumerate(posts):` to achieve the same result more cleanly."
