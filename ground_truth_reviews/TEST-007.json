      "comment": "This test uses `random.random()` to conditionally execute or skip, which introduces flakiness and non-determinism into the test suite. Tests should be deterministic to provide reliable feedback on code health. If the goal is to test a large number, it should be done unconditionally. If it depends on an external service that may not be available, that service should be mocked."
