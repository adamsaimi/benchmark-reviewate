      "comment": "The current implementation uses the `+=` operator inside a loop to build the report string. In Python, strings are immutable, so each `+=` operation creates a new string and copies the contents of the old and new parts. This results in O(n\u00b2) time complexity, which can be very slow if there is a large number of posts. To improve performance, it's recommended to append each formatted string to a list and then use `'\\n'.join()` at the end to create the final report string in a single, efficient operation."
