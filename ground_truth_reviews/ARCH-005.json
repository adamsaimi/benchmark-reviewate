      "comment": "This top-level import creates a circular dependency. The `post_service` now imports router `posts`. This will cause the application to fail at startup with an `ImportError`. To fix this, we should break the cycle, perhaps by using dependency injection to provide the user service instance where needed, or by refactoring the user validation logic to a higher-level component that coordinates both services."
