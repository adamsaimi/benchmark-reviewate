      "comment": "The pagination offset calculation contains an off-by-one error. By calculating the offset as `page * per_page` for a 1-indexed page number, the query skips an entire page of results. For instance, requesting page 1 with 10 items per page results in an offset of 10, which incorrectly fetches items 11-20 instead of 1-10. To fix this for 1-based page indexing, the offset should be calculated as `offset = (page - 1) * per_page`."
