      "comment": "The current implementation uses integer division (`//`) to calculate the discount amount. This leads to a loss of precision, as any fractional part of the discount is truncated. For example, a 15% discount on a price of 150 would be calculated as 22 instead of 22.5, resulting in an incorrect final price. For financial calculations, it's crucial to maintain precision. You should use float division (`/`) or, for better accuracy with currency, use the `Decimal` type from the `decimal` module to perform these calculations."
