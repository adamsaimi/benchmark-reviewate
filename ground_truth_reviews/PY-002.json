      "comment": "The use of a bare `except:` clause is a dangerous practice. It catches all exceptions, including system-level ones like `SystemExit` and `KeyboardInterrupt`, which can prevent the application from shutting down gracefully. More importantly, it hides all programming errors (like `TypeError`, `AttributeError`, etc.) that might occur within the `try` block, making debugging extremely difficult. Instead of catching all possible exceptions, you should only catch specific, expected exceptions (e.g., `PostNotFoundException`) and let unexpected ones propagate so they can be logged and fixed."
