This can lead to incorrect search results if the provided email has a different casing than the one stored in the database (e.g., 'user@example.com' vs. 'User@Example.com'). To ensure correctness, you should normalize both emails to a common case, typically lowercase, before comparing them: `if post_dict[\"author_email\"].lower() == email.lower():`."
