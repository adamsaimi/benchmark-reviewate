      "comment": "This line directly accesses `post.author.email` without checking if `post.author` could be `None`. If a post is ever retrieved without its author relationship being loaded, this will raise an `AttributeError` and cause a 500 Internal Server Error. To improve robustness, you should add a check to ensure `post.author` is not `None` before accessing its attributes. If it is `None`, you should handle it gracefully, for example by raising a 404 HTTPException."
