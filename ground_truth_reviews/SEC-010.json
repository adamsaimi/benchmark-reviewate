      "comment": "This log statement exposes sensitive user information by logging the entire `post_create` object. The object contains personally identifiable information (PII) such as `author_email` and potentially sensitive user-generated `content`. Logging PII can lead to serious security vulnerabilities and compliance issues if the logs are ever compromised. Instead of logging the entire object, you should only log non-sensitive, relevant information, such as the post title or a generated post ID. For more robust logging, consider implementing structured logging with allow/block lists to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive fields."
