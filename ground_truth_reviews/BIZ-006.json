      "comment": "This implementation of `delete_post` only performs a soft delete by setting an `is_deleted` flag. This violates the business requirement for data retention, which mandates that user-related data must be permanently deleted and personal information anonymized 30 days after deactivation. We need to add a mechanism, like a scheduled background job, to periodically scan for soft-deleted posts and perform the permanent deletion and anonymization of `author_email` after the 30-day period has elapsed."

  "title": "feat: Implement post deletion functionality",
  "body": "This change adds a new service method, `delete_post`, to allow for removing posts. It implements a soft-delete pattern by flagging posts as deleted rather than permanently removing them from the database. This allows for potential recovery and keeps listing endpoints clean.
