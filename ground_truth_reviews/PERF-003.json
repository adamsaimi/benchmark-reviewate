      "comment": "This membership check inside the loop is inefficient. `existing_titles` is a list, so the `in` operator performs a linear search, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n*m) where n is the number of input titles and m is the number of existing posts. For large datasets, this will lead to significant performance degradation. To fix this, you should convert `existing_titles` to a set before the loop to leverage its O(1) average time complexity for lookups. For example: `existing_titles_set = set(existing_titles)` and then `if title in existing_titles_set:`."
