      "comment": "This endpoint simulates an expensive, time-consuming operation without any rate limiting. This makes it a prime target for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. An attacker can send a large number of requests in a short period, exhausting server resources and making the application unresponsive for legitimate users. To mitigate this vulnerability, you must implement rate limiting to control how frequently a client can call this endpoint. For instance, using a library like `slowapi`, you could apply a decorator like `@limiter.limit('5/minute')` to restrict usage."
