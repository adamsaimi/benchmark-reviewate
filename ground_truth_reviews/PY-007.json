      "comment": "The `create_post` function signature is missing type annotations for the `post_create` parameter and its return value. Adding type hints (e.g., `post_create: PostCreate` and `-> Post`) is crucial for code clarity and enables static analysis tools to catch errors early. In FastAPI, this also drives automatic request validation and response model serialization, so omitting them can lead to unexpected runtime behavior."
